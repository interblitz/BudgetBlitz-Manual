Connecting of transactions
--------------------------

Sometimes one wants to additionally connect transactions to have a real transfer. For a
example, you may want to connect two separate transactions when transfer was created by hands or
as a result of an import. To get transactions connected just check at least one transaction and
run the operation and the app will find and connect complement transactions automatic.

.. note::
  Starting from the version 6 both transactions are automatic connecting when transfer is
  made by hands, thus there is no need to additionally connect these transactions. Connecting
  transactions are marked by a special icon.

order to get a help it is required to show source data to the developer.
